-------------------------------------


This folder contains the training data for the SMS task at FIRE 2013. 

There are two folders in this directory:
1. FAQs
2. SMS_Queries

The FAQs folder has three sub-directories, one corresponding to each language that we have FAQs for. The 'English' subdirectory has a file eng.xml containing all the FAQs that we have for the 'English' language. (Similar folders exist for Hindi and Malayalam).

The XML has an outer <FAQS> tag within which each FAQ would be in the format as below:

<FAQ>
<FAQID>FAQ_ID</FAQID>
<DOMAIN>FAQ_DOMAIN</DOMAIN>
<QUESTION>FAQ_QUESTION</QUESTION>
<ANSWER>FAQ_ANSWER</ANSWER>
</FAQ>

There are 7251 FAQs in English, 1994 in Hindi and 681 in Malayalam. 
The FAQs are common for all the three tasks (Monolingual, CrossLingual and Multi-lingual retrieval).

In the SMS_Queries folder, we have three separate folders, one for each task. The XML files are within the appropriate folders.

Some file names contain the text "SPEECH". These queries have been generated using the speech transcription system, while the other files without this tag have been generated by SMS uers as in the previous years of the task.

Each of the SMS XML files has an outer <QUERIES> tag and each SMS within is of the following format:

<SMS>
<SMS_QUERY_ID>QUERY_ID</SMS_QUERY_ID>
<SMS_TEXT>QUERY_TEXT</SMS_TEXT>
<MATCHES>
<ENGLISH>ENG_MATCHED_FAQID1,ENG_MATCHED_FAQID2</ENGLISH>
<MALAYALAM>MALAYALAM_MATCHED_FAQID1</MALAYALAM> <!-- NOT PRESENT IN SOME FILES THE MALAYALAM TASK IS NOT BEING HELD THIS YEAR -->
<HINDI>HINDI_MATCHED_FAQID1</HINDI>
</MATCHES>
</SMS>

For each SMS, the corresponding FAQ matches are within the <MATCHES> tag (and in language tags within the MATCHES tag). If there are multiple matches in a language, they are have been provided, seperated by commas. The matches are based on the  content of the <QUESTION> tag, that is the "text of the question" and not the "answers" of the FAQ. However, the partcipants may utilize the content of the <ANSWERS> to aid in matching.

For the SMS queries for the mono-lingual tasks, only the same language matches (matches of the same language as the query is) are provided. 

For cross-lingual, all necessary matches are provided. 

Each of the SMS query files contain a few out of domain queries (i.e queries that will not match any FAQ).
